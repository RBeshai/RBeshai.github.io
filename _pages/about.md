Welcome! I am a question-driven marine ecologist, interested in understanding broad-scale drivers of population and community change. I'm currently a postdoctoral scholar in the [Raimondi-Carr lab](https://rclab.ucsc.edu/), where I'm interfacing with the National Parks Service - specifically Acadia National Park - to understand how long-term pressures (sea level rise and increasing temperatures) affect the organization and stability of rocky intertidal communities in the US Northeast. I was previously a Ph.D. student in the [Sorte Lab](https://cascadesorte.org/) in the Ecology & Evolutionary Biology Department at the University of California, Irvine.
