Welcome! I am a question-driven, marine ecologist, interested in understanding broad-scale drivers of population and community change. I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the [Sorte Lab](https://cascadesorte.org/) in the Ecology & Evolutionary Biology Department at the University of California, Irvine. 

Please feel free to explore around the site for a better understanding of my research and links to my work!
