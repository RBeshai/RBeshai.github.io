## Predicting Impacts of Species' Range Shifts 

Climatic warming is causing species to undergo broad-scale geographic redistributions [across virtually all systems and taxa](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aai9214). These "range-shifts" typically occur toward to higher latitudes (i.e, poleward), toward higher elevations, or - in marine sytems - toward greater depths. Though these shifts may facilitate biodiversity preservation on a global scale, they may also negatively impact recipient populations and communities via novel interspecific interactions. [Early reseach](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2009.00519.x) suggests that the impacts of these [neonative species](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article-abstract/69/11/908/5569676) on recipient populations and communities comprable to impacts caused by human-driven invasive species. However, there are currently no frameworks for proactively predicting the impacts of neonative species.

Therefore, my current reserach focuses on developing frameworks that can be used to predict the impact of neonative speies on recipient populations and communities prior to (or during) expansion. To do so, I am (1) conducting a regional-scale manipulative field experiment, leveraging the expansions of two intertidal predators, the whelks *Acanthinucella spirata* and *Mexacanthina lububris* (pictured below: *Acanthinucella* left, *Mexacanthina* right), to test impact predictions derived from invasion biology theory, and (2) conducting a global-scale meta-analysis to apply the [EICAT risk-assessment framework](https://iucn.org/resources/conservation-tool/environmental-impact-classification-alien-taxa) to neonative species.

## Interactions Between Invasive Species 

The global rate of establishment of human-driven exotic species is [increasing, with few signs of slowing](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14435). The [impacts of invasive species can be tremendous](https://zenodo.org/records/10677193) - estimated to directly or indirectly drive up to 60% of documented extinctions, with human-related costs exceeding $423 billion globally in 2019 - so it is critical to understand factors that promote or impede future invasions. While invasion theory holds that community diversity is a critcal factor in modulating invasion success, prominent hypotheses occasionally make diverging predictions. For example, the biotic resistance (BR) hypothesis holds that species rich communities are more resistant to invasion than species-poor communities due to mechanisms including greater interspecific competition while the invasional meltdown hypothesis (IMH) proposes that greater exotic diversity increases invasibility via facilitative interactions between exotic species. In this project, I compared predictions made the biotic resistance and invasional meltdown hypotheses by tracking the assembly of fouling communities and abundance of exotic species in southern California.

# Scientists in Parks (via National Parks Service)

## Assessing Community Change over Time 

A primary directive of the National Parks service is to protect and conserve natural resources for the enjoyment of future generations. Management of resources in parks, however, is complicated by frequently high visitation rates. In 2020, for example, [over 350,000 individuals](https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/DownloadFile/684235) visited Cabrillo National Monument's rocky intertidal communities. So how does a highly-visited park such as [Cabrillo National Monument](https://www.nps.gov/cabr/index.htm) ensure that its management practices are effective? As a Scientists in Parks natural resources intern, I used long-term survey data to examine changes in intertidal community composition across sites representing a gradient of human use and compared changes in Cabrillo National Monument to other high- and low-visitation sites in southern California.

## Apparent Competition 

Direct competitive interactions are well-described in many plant and animal communities. Among phytophagous insects, however, there is [little consensus](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2007.01093.x) in the importance of direct - and particularly indirect - competitive interactions. As an undergradute in the [Murphy Lab](https://smurphlab.weebly.com/), I therefore examined the role of apparent competition (i.e., competition mediated by a shared enemy) using two species of generalist phytophagous insects (Fall Webworms, *Hyphantria cunea*, and Eastern Tent Caterpillars, *Malacosoma californicum*) in Colorado.
