## Predicting Impacts of Species' Range Shifts 

Climatic warming is causing species to undergo broad-scale geographic redistributions [across virtually all systems and taxa](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aai9214). These "range-shifts" typically occur toward to higher latitudes (i.e, poleward), toward higher elevations, or - in marine sytems - toward greater depths. Though these shifts may facilitate biodiversity preservation on a global scale, they may also negatively impact recipient populations and communities via novel interspecific interactions. [Early reseach](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2009.00519.x) suggests that the impacts of these [neonative species](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article-abstract/69/11/908/5569676) on recipient populations and communities comprable to impacts caused by human-driven invasive species. However, there are currently no frameworks for proactively predicting the impacts of neonative species.

Therefore, my current reserach focuses on developing frameworks that can be used to predict the impact of neonative speies on recipient populations and communities prior to (or during) expansion. To do so, I am (1) conducting a regional-scale experiment, leveraging the expansions of two intertidal predators, the whelks *Acanthinucella spirata* and *Mexacanthina lububris* (pictured below: *Acanthinucella* left, *Mexacanthina* right), to test predictions derived from invasion biology theory, and (2) conducting a global-scale meta-analysis to apply the [EICAT risk-assessment framework](https://iucn.org/resources/conservation-tool/environmental-impact-classification-alien-taxa) to neonative species.
